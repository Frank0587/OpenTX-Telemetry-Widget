## Configuration Menu

### Legacy Radios (Taranis etc.)

**Long press** the `Menu` button to display the configuration options menu:

* Use the dial or +/- buttons to cycle through the menu or select the desired setting
* Press Enter/dial to select and deselect a menu option
* Press `Exit` or `RTN` to deselect a menu option or escape the configuration menu

### "Horus" (Horus, Jumper T16, RM TX16S, Nirvana) - "Colour" / large screen radios

* Must be unarmed to access the config menu when running as a widget
* Use the following (mode 2) stick controls to navigate the config menu:

### Other radios

The following applies generically to all non-Colour (B&W) / small screen radios:

In particular, there are a number of recent smaller ('budget') radios, often with few discrete buttons and a small screen. The paucity of discrete buttons and non-standardisation of their function makes finding a common button press somewhat problematic.

The INAV Lua Telemetry widget uses a **long button press** as defined by the firmware button event `EVT_VIRTUAL_MENU_LONG` ("Virtual Menu Button, Long Press").  `EVT_VIRTUAL_MENU_LONG` is a feature implemented by the firmware developers to make it easy for Lua scripts to access a menu button across diverse hardware designs.

The physical button mapped to the virtual button depends on the radio, but is often the `MDL` (Model) button, so a **long press on `MDL` / Model** will display the configuration menu the non-colour radios.

In order to facilitate identifying the MDL / Model button on radios where the vendor documentation is unclear, a Button Test Tool is provided.

### Button Test Tool

* There is a "Button Test" Lua script `INAVButtons.lua` available from the TX Tools menu (or `SCRIPTS/TOOLS` that can be used in both the Companion / Simulator and on the physical radio to verify the buttons available to Lua (not all buttons are available to Lua which is part of the problem). You may have to experiment (easiest in Companion) to find the `EVT_VIRTUAL_MENU_LONG` button for your radio, in particular for some of more wacky designs (here's looking at you iFlight).
* If the  button event `EVT_VIRTUAL_MENU_LONG` is not available for your transmitter, then you will not be able to access the configuration menu.
* If the  button event `EVT_VIRTUAL_MENU_LONG` is available on the Companion but not on the physical radio (or vice-versa), then consider raising an issue with the firmware developer or radio vendor. Due to the (lack of) availability of all hardware to the maintainer, this project can only support radios where the behaviour in the Companion and on the radio is consistent.
* The test tool is closed by a **long press** on the `RTN` button.

Note also that on some of the smaller B&W radios (Boxer, Zorro, TX12) with a roller:
* The configuration menu is accessed via the `EVT_VIRTUAL_MENU_LONG` button press (not by the roller, which was intercepted by the OS)
* The configuration options are accessed via the roller.

### Suggested Battery Settings
#### Voltage and Current Calibration

1. Using a multimeter, calibrate the voltage with the "Voltage Scale" in INAV configurator
1. If you have a current sensor, make sure you [calibrate it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWjblvHgjjI)

#### In INAV Configurator

* Voltage source to use for alarms and telemetry: **Raw**
* Number of cells: **0** (0=auto, set if you always use the same cell count)
* Maximum cell voltage for cell count detection: **4.3**
* Minimum cell voltage: **3.4** (match "Cell Critical" in Lua Telemetry)
* Maximum cell voltage: **4.2**
* Warning cell voltage: **3.5** (match "Cell Low" in Lua Telemetry)
* Set capacity in **mAh** to battery capacity
* Warning capacity: **30%** (match "Fuel Low" in Lua Telemetry)
* Critical capacity: **10%**

### In INAV CLI (ignore for TBS Crossfire)

* `set smartport_fuel_unit = percent`
* `set report_cell_voltage = OFF` (if set to `ON` Lua Telemetry can't show total battery voltage)

#### In Lua Telemetry

* Cell Low: **3.5V** (match "Warning cell voltage" in INAV)
* Cell Critical: **3.4V** (match "Minimum cell voltage" in INAV)
* Fuel Unit: **Percent**
* Fuel Low: **30%** (match "Warning capacity" in INAV)
* Fuel Critical: **20%**

## Playback Telemetry Log Files

!!!warning
    Telemetry log file playback works well on colour / large screen transmitters.  On older B&W radios, there may not be sufficient resources.
.

Log file playback allows you to playback the latest 5 telemetry log files from up to the last 2 weeks on the currently selected model.  You must be _unarmed_ for this to work and if you arm while playing back a log file, the playback will be terminated.

Note also that replay only supports OpenTX file naming semantics; `<MODEL_NAME>-YYYY-MM-DD.csv`. If you wish to replay logs on EdgeTX, you will need to rename the log file appropriately (i.e. remove the time component).

### Setup

Before you can playback a telemetry log file you need to make sure you're logging your telemetry.  By default for each telemetry sensor, the **Logs** option is already checked (unless you unchecked it).  However, it still won't log unless you setup a special function.  In the model setup on your transmitter, page to the **SPECIAL FUNCTIONS** page.  In an empty slot, create a special function that's activated from a switch.  It should look something like this (e.g for switch `SF`):

```
SF1	SFâ†“	SD Logs 	0.2s
```

This will log your telemetry 5 times per second when the switch is enabled.  You can set this up on any switch you'd like, but the arm switch is common.  You can also change the value to 0.1s to log 10 times a second or any other value you wish.  Note that the log playback will be smoother if you select a lower log frequency value.

### Playback

To playback a log file, go to the config menu and scroll to the last item.  If there's any log files in the last 2 weeks, you'll see a date (in YY-MM-DD format).  You can cycle through the dates and select the one you wish to playback (exit will unselect the menu option).

Standard playback will be at close to normal speed (note the timestamp in the title bar).  When playing back, you can use the right stick (mode 2) to fast forward (stick up), reverse (stick down), pause (hold stick right), or quit (stick left).  The further you move the stick up and down the faster the forward or reverse.  The stick center position is playback at normal speed.  When it gets to the end of the log, it will pause.

In OpenTX, multiple flights from the same day are recorded to the same telemetry log files, the playback will continue to the next flight (note the timestamp in the title for time jumps which will be a new flight).
